**OVERVIEW**

One of the frustrating moments for learners is when working on a project or writing a thesis and you come across several information that are inspiring and educative, and you are trying to put them all together as a solid point for your work and then just to realise that you did not write down the page, chapter, or title of the article.

As far back as I could say the alphabet without stuttering and knowing how to read and write. One of my self-awareness moments is being an organized reader with an intuitive mind of capturing everything I glance on. For this reason, I wished my collections of books were highlighted digitally for future reference instead of relying on the traditional methods. 

With the implementation of Glasp - a socila higlighter, my wish was fulfilled. Today, I can comfortably read, and share my thoughts by highlighting my notes, research articles, books and connect with other learners globally.
